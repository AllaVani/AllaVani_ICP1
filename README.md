Assignment-1

Program1:
1.a) Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it.
Notes:For a string called "Python" need to perform deltion operation of two characters so when we delete 2 random characters from string 't' and 'p' are deleted then after performing reverse operation we get "nohy".

1.b)Take two numbers from user and perform at least 4 arithmetic operations on them
Notes:For any two numbers we are performing Addition,Subraction,Multiplication and Division.
example if i take num1=5 and num2=10 then
addition=11
subraction=-1
Multipilcation=30
Division=0.83333333333

2.Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’.

Notes: In this program we need to replace the sentence with a particular new string that we want to print in the place of existing string with adding 's' to that string.
Example sentence is "vani likes Python" my output is "vani likes Pythons"

3.	Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class.

Notes: We need to give grades based on marks obtained and to build this program i used if and elif statement conditions so that we can easily print statements for particular gardes
For grade A score>=90
For grade B score>=80
For grade C score>=70
For grade D score>=60
For grade F score<60
